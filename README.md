# Hyperion

The `develop` and `main` branches contain minor modifications to the code. If you're purely
interested in the original Hyperion, please see the `original` branch, which is a direct
migration of the SVN repository.

## Setup Guide

This version of Hyperion has RSA enabled. In order to connect to the server, you will
need to generate the keys and add them to your client. You can generate them by running
the following in the main Hyperion project directory:

```bash
./gradlew generateRsaKeys
```

Upon running that command, you should see a similar output:

```
Place these keys in the client:
--------------------
public key: 65537
modulus: 100999061926131320211890128666520087044777396539376882501708703887408682559233168572277885244928601348273981834183968902153392673861546835559668044531568388256847825570496603537958729305524576420199594801586428179840063025548573925412227035737104387206365804547524209280051245052897314615859962743072062243209
```

Additionally, you should now have two new files, `data/rsa-private.pem` and 
`data/rsa-public.pem`. Next, you'll need to go ahead and ensure RSA is enabled in 
your client. Start by locating the login method inside the main client
class. You can usually do this by searching for `36 + 1 + 1 + 2`, which should 
bring up code similar to the following:

```java
out.encrypt(RSA_EXPONENT, RSA_MODULUS);
login.position = 0;
if (reconnect) {
    login.put1(18);
} else {
    login.put1(16);
}
login.put1(out.position + 36 + 1 + 1 + 2);
login.put1(255);
login.put2(317);
```

In this case, we're looking for the `out#encrypt()` method. Navigate to it and ensure
it looks similar to the following:

```java
public void encrypt(BigInteger exponent, BigInteger modulus) {
    int length = position;
    position = 0;
    byte[] raw = new byte[length];
    get(raw, 0, length);
    byte[] encrypted = new BigInteger(raw).modPow(exponent, modulus).toByteArray();
    position = 0;
    put1(encrypted.length);
    put(encrypted, 0, encrypted.length);
}
```

The important parts to take note of are:

```java
byte[] encrypted = new BigInteger(raw).modPow(exponent, modulus).toByteArray();
put1(encrypted.length);
put(encrypted, 0, encrypted.length);
```

Some clients may skip the encryption and simply write the raw buffer contents. If yours
skips the encryption process, please ensure you modify it to match the earlier example.

For a full reference of what each method does, please see [Dane's refactored buffer](https://github.com/thedaneeffect/RuneScape-317/blob/67c29aec892952d9b57ea6fd1387a37bd850c78d/src/main/java/Buffer.java#L335).

Next, take the output of the key generation from earlier and place the "public key" in
the exponent `BigInteger` and pace the modulus in the modulus `BigInteger`. If your
encrypt method never had these arguments to begin with, you can simply declare these
as static fields somewhere, like in your client class:

```java
public static final BigInteger RSA_MODULUS = new BigInteger("142327727008591673659846668239173186274361869919189896495127734028768384638560081884799220286290877235637102257574243057441820214777818794007187521887790798934792282873284438098369130136061859136221686643379278315806063383838237040384659523069407115879143650679163364509413863075654095423928375505587455863687");
public static final BigInteger RSA_EXPONENT = new BigInteger("65537");
```

# **Hyperion:** *the open-source Java gameserver suite*

#### **About**

Hyperion is a Java gameserver suite server which aims to provide an excellent, stable, quality base with advanced features such as update server (to stream the cache to the client) and login server (for multi-world support with cross world messaging).

The server has been developed completely from scratch, even the ISAAC cipher code is scratch (as the one used by most is copyrighted Jagex - from a deob).

There are lots of unique ideas: we are spending time making the server good and high quality instead of cramming lots of features in a small amount of time.

Also, for those working on their own servers, there is documentation on the login, update and in-game protocol, and information about the updating and walking procedures.

#### **Unique features**

**Action system:**

The action system is another first which is going to prove quite unique as it is developed. There is an Action class and ActionQueue class. The ActionQueue will queue and process actions for a player.

Since a lot of actions share code (i.e. woodcutting and mining are extremely similar), there are some abstract classes such as AbstractHarvestingAction which will contain code common to both.

These allow rapid development and easy bug fixing, as well as just looking cool.

**Cached update blocks:**

Say you had 100 players in a region, and then a new one logs in. In a traditional server, each 100 players will reconstruct the new player's appearance update block when they login. This server will cache update blocks for the duration of the cycle, so it only happens once, at the expense of slightly more memory usage.

This should give some improvements when there are a lot of players in an area, especially if the updates are large (like appearance blocks).

**Pooled player updating:**

Player updating is a read only task. This means you can execute it in multiple threads safely. The server creates a thread pool with the same number of cores as the current computer it is running on, and dispatches update tasks to this pool.

To prevent threading issues, the main thread will block until all the updates are complete. Then the main thread may run as usual, processing packets and performing reads and writes safely with little worry of thread-safety.

This can give vast improvements when you have a PC with multiple cores and/or processors. If you look at the screenshot above, which was taken on a dual core PC, the server is using around 80% of the CPU which means it is taking advantage of both cores (otherwise it would be at or below 50%).

There are classes allowing you to do this as well (namely the ParallelTask class), however, there are few remaining cases in which this is possible to do safely.

**Update server:**

The update server uses the ondemand and a HTTP/0.9-like protocol to stream the cache to the client just like a popular MMORPG. This gives a few advantages: when the cache is modified, it can be pushed out to all new clients very easily with minimum bandwidth used up by subsequent updates (the files in the cache are only updated when the client deems it necessary). Also, no client modifications are needed to make it work (assuming you are using the original deob).

#### **Benchmark**

I've done some testing and it seems the server can handle 2000 players without crashing. However, **these are not real players** so not entirely accurate. Also, bear in mind the server in fact has very few features and this will have an impact on performance (in a real server if you had 2000 players they would be performing actions).

For those interested in how the benchmark was setup, the SYI attacker was run on the same PC as the server. The PC is dual core, 2.2ghz. With the way in which the server is setup it would perform better on more cores, as not just the input/output is done in a multi-threaded manner. The throttle filter was disabled. With it enabled, they will connect slowly. Also, there is no limit per IP yet.

While this number of players are online, the server is still usable (logins are slower than normal - as expected - but there isn't much lag).
